### Background

No later than June 29th, 2015, CareLink updated their CSV format. We are not sure of the precise date and time when the update occurred, but we started seeing reports of the uploader failing to process CareLink data on the 29th, so the update definitely occurred at some time previous to that date.

## Changes

### Settings

In many rows that we process in order to build a device settings history from the CareLink data, fields within the 'Raw-Values' column for these rows have been renamed (in all cases adding an `_ID` suffix). The renamings are:

- `BG_TARGET_RANGE_PATTERN_DATUM` → `BG_TARGET_RANGE_PATTERN_DATUM_ID`
- `CARB_RATIO_PATTERN_DATUM` → `CARB_RATIO_PATTERN_DATUM_ID`
- `INSULIN_SENSITIVITY_PATTERN_DATUM` → `INSULIN_SENSITIVITY_PATTERN_DATUM_ID`
- `NEW_CONFIG_DATUM` → `NEW_CONFIG_DATUM_ID`
- `OLD_CONFIG_DATUM` → `OLD_CONFIG_DATUM_ID`
- `PATTERN_DATUM` → `PATTERN_DATUM_ID`

The datatypes/rows affected by (various of) these changes are:

- `ChangeBasalProfile`
- `ChangeBasalProfilePre`
- `ChangeBGTargetRange`
- `CurrentBGTargetRange`
- `ChangeCarbRatio`
- `CurrentCarbRatio`
- `ChangeInsulinSensitivity`
- `CurrentInsulinSensitivity`
- `ChangeBolusWizardSetup`
- `ChangeBolusWizardSetupConfig`

### Blood Glucose

The `CalBGForPH` and `CalBGForGH` rows/datatypes are no longer present. A new datatype/row `BGCapturedOnPump` has replaced the former, and `SensorCalBG` has replaced the latter. There are no changes in the 'Raw-Values' column for these rows.

### Suspend Events

The `ChangeSuspendEnable` rows/datatypes are no longer present. A new datatype/row `ChangeSuspendState` has replaced the old `ChangeSuspendEnable`. In addition, there are changes in the 'Raw-Values' column for these rows:

- `ENABLE` → `STATE`
- `PRE_ENABLE` → `PRESTATE`

The set of possible values of the `STATE` has not changed from the set that appeared with `ENABLE`, namely:

- `user_restart_basal`
- `low_suspend_no_response`
- `low_suspend_user_selected`
- `auto_resume_reduced`
- `user_suspend`
- `alarm_suspend`
- `low_suspend_mode_1`
- `normal_pumping`
- `auto_resume_complete`
