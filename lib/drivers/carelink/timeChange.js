       * This is a pretty ugly hack to filter out completely spurious time changes that
       * appear in the data when the battery is left out for too long.
       * The strategy is to filter out any time change to a date where the year is
       * less than the current year minus one. So, for example, since I'm writing this in 2015,
       * any time changes to any date in 2013 or earlier will be filtered out.
       * (Since we only pull 6 months of CareLink data at a time, this seems reasonably secure.)
       *
       * Depending on the model of device, the time changes do not always go to the same date.
       * For example, some devices "reset" to 2008-01-01T00:00:00 and some to 2012-01-01...
       * (The 2012 resets also do not always go to midnight but I've seen to T00:02:00 and T00:05:00)
